# ⚠️ NOTE:

## THIS IS AN EARLY VERSION OF THE ENGINE❗❗ the code behind this isnt too polished yet!

a port of super mario 64's movment code and various object utilities into roblox luau. currently you can spawn goombas and some other stuff go FIGURE IT OUT AGHHH

compared to nobonet's fork, this one fixes innaccuracies (not all) and included objects ported (for the most part, WIP)

some models are just completely missing like the goomba, if u want one u can get one [here](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/138138557632335/Goomba-OPEN-SOURCE-WITH-CODE) i dunno, i dont feel like documenting this yet
